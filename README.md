# Pyrrhonist

A Ruby PGM library. Inspired by concepts and algorithms taught in [Daphne Koller's PGM class on Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/pgm-2012-002/class/index)

## Goals

I'm building this library partly to internalize the lectures and to also provide this to the Ruby community. The library will include:

* Bayesian Networks with causal inference
* Markov Network representation
* Table and Tree Factors
* Template model generation
* Exact inference algorithms (Variable Elimination, Belief Propagation)
* Approximate inference algorithms (MCMC)
* and more!
